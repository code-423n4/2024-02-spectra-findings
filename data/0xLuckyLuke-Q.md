## Streamlining Token Handling in Flash Loan Functions
Simplified Token Handling: The _token parameter in the flashLoan function seems unnecessary since the token address (ibt) remains constant throughout the function. Removing this parameter would streamline the interface.

Efficient Loan Calculation: The maxFlashLoan function accurately determines the maximum loan amount based on the contract's token balance, returning 0 if the token address differs from ibt.

Secure Fee Computation: The flashFee function calculates fees exclusively for the designated token (ibt) and ensures safety by reverting with an AddressError if the provided token address doesn't match.

Overall: The functions demonstrate clear logic and adhere to best practices for flash loan implementations, with potential for interface simplification and efficient token handling.

```diff
function flashLoan(
    IERC3156FlashBorrower _receiver,
-    address _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes calldata _data
) external override returns (bool) {
-    if (_amount > maxFlashLoan(_token)) revert FlashLoanExceedsMaxAmount();
+    if (_amount > maxFlashLoan(ibt)) revert FlashLoanExceedsMaxAmount();

-    uint256 fee = flashFee(_token, _amount);
+    uint256 fee = flashFee(ibt, _amount);
    _updateFees(fee);

    // Initiate the flash loan by lending the requested IBT amount
    IERC20(ibt).safeTransfer(address(_receiver), _amount);

    // Execute the flash loan
-    if (_receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, _token, _amount, fee, _data) != ON_FLASH_LOAN)
+    if (_receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, ibt, _amount, fee, _data) != ON_FLASH_LOAN)
        revert FlashLoanCallbackFailed();

    // Repay the debt + fee
    IERC20(ibt).safeTransferFrom(address(_receiver), address(this), _amount + fee);

    return true;
}
```


## Enhancing _beforeWithdraw/_beforeRedeem Preparations:

Conditional Optimization:

The function checks _owner against msg.sender and reverts if they differ.
Permit verification should occur only when _owner is not the caller.
Refactored Logic:

Reorder conditionals to prioritize permit checking for non-owner callers.
Consolidate conditional checks for improved readability and efficiency.

```diff
    if (_owner != msg.sender) {
+       // Permit check for non-owner callers
+       if (!checkPermit(_owner)) {
            revert UnauthorizedCaller();
+       }
    ...
```
